# StorytellerAI

## Description

We believe that a brighter future lies in the hands of the bright minds of the children of today. As adults, we might be changing today but kids are the tomorrow of humanity. For a bright future ahead of us we need bright minds to walk the path that lies ahead of the world. Sadly, the content that the newer generation has been exposed to recently has been extremely toxic and repetitive making a toxically addictive environment for the young ones while hindering their mental development. As many of our own related cousins and siblings already suffer from the same fate as most children exposed to the internet today, we felt compelled to bring a change for the betterment of our future. We place our values in the importance of a curious, creative and educated mind and to ensure that our future generation has an environment to promote such development, we came up with Storyteller AI. Our AI aims to provide a very comfortable space for children of any age to learn something through an interactive story ranging over 20+ genres and over 15 types of emotions. The AI is very easy to use with little to no user input required and produces very creative and engaging outputs to make sure that the users don't lose any sense of interest. It frequently asks you regarding the course of the story and your opinion on the plot so far and it uses that data to generate further parts of the story with your feedbacks and preferences in mind. It ensures friendly, comfortable, inspiring, and safe conditions for the user while being very creative and respectful at the same time.

## Installation

-Install python.env.
-Install Visual Studios Code.
-Install eleven labs.
-Install gradio.
-Generate API key from elevenlabs
-Install gradio model.
-Generate openAI key.

## Usage

We first laid out the plan for the project and decided what APIs to use for different parts of our project. After researching more about the sponsors, we decided the most suitable APIs for our workload. We decided to use OpenAI API as the basic chatbot training model, Gradio for the front-end, Elevenlabs for text-to-speech and the RAFT method for prompt engineering. After distributing the workload amongst the team members, we made sure to communicate with each other to ensure the reliability of each and every step.

## Challenges

We are CS majors so we don't know how to communicate with each other
This was our first hackathon so we barely had any idea of what 'hackathon' means
Some sponsor APIs were very very very hard to integrate into our project so we spent hours and all of our mental health trying to make something work that we didn't need.

## Future Development

Storyteller AI has limitless opportunities and we plan on making the best out of them. We are further going to implement Speech-to-Speech for even easier access to children. 
We plan on a big update later on in the future where we integrate Hume AI into our project and analyze the emotions of the user on the basis of speech interactions and generate the story to elevate any negative feelings so that the user feels more comfortable, understood and connected.
Finally we plan on integrating image generation for potential reference to make the story more engaging for the user.
